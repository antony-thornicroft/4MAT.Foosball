# 4MAT.Foosball
4MAT Foosball Interface

Introduction
4MAT have some very competitive Foosball players who are endlessly arguing over who is the best player. These arguments have now been taken up by our clients, and it is starting to drag the business off track. As a result, a developer has started writing a dotnet core 2.0 web application to track the scores of the 4MAT staff, and make them available to our very demanding clients.


Requirements
The developer has promised that the application will:

•	Allow users to enter player scores 
•	Allow clients to see a leader board
•	Look like the signed off designs
•	Allow users to input and view scores across desktop, tablet and mobile devices

He also told people that it might:

•	Show trends over different periods of time
•	Give us a breakdown of when people play
•	Send an email, Microsoft Teams message or other browser notification to tell us who has won for every week


Project details
4MAT has created the basic structure of a project for you which can be found here: https://github.com/lawrence-anstey/4MAT.Foosball

We also have the design artefacts included within the project, they include the PSD’s, annotated designs, font and icon files


Presentation of work
Please email your completed project to Sham.Ahmed@NoirConsulting.co.uk or send Sham a link to a Drop Box or Google drive location. Please ensure all files required for us to be able to run the project are included.

We will require you to demonstrate your code to us and answer questions about your approach and the decisions you’ve made.
